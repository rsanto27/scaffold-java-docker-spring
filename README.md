# seed-java-springboot.
This is a seed, studded from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-ionic/). In this seed we use spring boot to initiate the technologies. The jdk used was the 11 LTS. Here we will describe how to mount the ambient.

1. Install java 11 LTS.
2. Use the update alternatives from linux to set the java11 the default installation, or set this inside eclipse.
3. Download the Eclipse IDE.
4. Inside Eclipse, install from Eclipse Market place the **Spring Tools 4** by VMware.
5. Clone the project from repository.
6. Import the project like a maven.
7. Run the class `SeedJavaSpringbootApplication` like a **spring boot app**.
8. the server will respond at localhost:8080. If you already have the 8080 door used. you must change it on `Application.properties` by the property `server.port`
